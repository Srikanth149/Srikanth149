# âœ… 1. Preprocessing Layer (Input â†’ Model-Ready Data)

# This is where we convert raw user input into a format the model understands.

# ðŸ”¹ Steps:

# User Input: The raw text (e.g., "The cat sat on the mat").

# Tokenizer â†’ Token IDs:

# Tokenizer breaks text into subword units (e.g., "The", "cat", "sat").

# Adds special tokens like [CLS] (for classification), [SEP], or <pad>.

# Converts tokens into unique integer IDs.


# Teacher Forcing (for decoder models only):

# During training, the actual target sequence is shifted and fed as input.

# Helps the model learn to predict the next token based on previous ground truth tokens.

# âœ… 2. Model Layer (Transformer Forward Pass)

# This is the core of the Transformer. It transforms the tokenized input into contextual representations.

# ðŸ”¹ Steps:

# Embeddings:

# Token IDs are converted into vectors (e.g., 768-dimensional).

# Positional embeddings are added to capture token order.


Pass to Model (LLM):

Inputs are passed through multiple transformer layers.


Self-Attention (inside each layer):

Q (Query), K (Key), V (Value) matrices are computed from inputs.

Semantic relevance is calculated using Q Â· Káµ€ / âˆšd.

Softmax is applied to get attention weights.

Attention weights are multiplied with V to aggregate meaningful info.


Multi-head Attention:

This process happens in parallel across multiple heads (e.g., 12 heads Ã— 64D each).

Outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed.


Final Hidden State:

After all layers, we extract the final token representations.

For classification: [CLS] token is used.

For generation: each token's last hidden state is used.

âœ… 3. Output Layer (Prediction, Loss, Optimization)

This layer converts the hidden states into predictions and updates the model during training.

ðŸ”¹ Steps:

Softmax on final hidden state:

Applies to each tokenâ€™s final vector.

Converts logits into probabilities over vocabulary (or classes).


Loss Calculation:

Compares predicted logits with true labels using cross-entropy loss.


Backward Propagation:

Gradients of loss w.r.t. each weight are computed.


Optimizer Step:

Optimizer (e.g., Adam) updates weights to minimize loss.

ðŸŽ¤ Interview Closing Statement:

> "So the entire LLM pipeline can be cleanly explained in three layers â€” preprocessing to prepare model-ready inputs, the transformer layers to capture deep contextual relationships via attention, and finally the output layer to make predictions and update the model through gradient-based optimization."
